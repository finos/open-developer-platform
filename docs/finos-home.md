# Working Group Charter
The Open Developer Platform Working Group is tasked with advising and prioritizing of the building and managing of FINOS infrastructure that FINOS members are able to access for communication and open source software development, also known as the Open Developer Platform (ODP); this includes capturing expressions of interest both for  consuming ODP components, and contributing new ones.

The Working Group **collaboratively maintains a [prioritized backlog](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?projectKey=ODP&useStoredSettings=true&rapidView=10) of requirements**, and the FINOS Infra team - with the help of FINOS Community - independently works through that backlog in priority order.

The ODP Working Group validates requirements with the Developer Experience Working Group to ingest their established best practices and seek guidance when needed.

The ODP Working Group was **approved by the PMC on 21 June 2018.**

# What is the Open Developer Platform
The Open Developer Platform (ODP) is a **fully hosted developer platform** offered free of charge **to all our software contributors**; it is composed of **communication and software development tools**, and can be plugged with additional build automations tools.

You can find more info on the ODP Wiki page.

# How to sign up
Anyone can **self sign up to [Wiki](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki) and [mailing lists](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/77955298/Getting+in+Touch)**, where all of the FINOS community communication is conducted. If you can’t access or sign up, please open a JIRA issue with this [pre-filled form](https://docs.google.com/document/u/2/d/1BH0GMvd6EPhuLSUnY_B5c2DyzErXcHOkao-lC9Ytq5U/edit), it is an extremely valuable contribution for us.

When the first code contribution is submitted, our cla-bot will walk you through the [legal requirements](https://finosfoundation.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FINOS/pages/75530375/Legal+Requirements) and the FINOS Infra team will grant you access to the additional ODP components.

# What and how to contribute
If you're a **developer at a financial institution** (who may already be a FINOS member), facing challenges when developing open source software, join our group to share experiences and opinions.

If you're a **software vendor** providing **build automation** for open source software that can help solve friction points many developers at financial institutions face, we'd be happy to work together and host your technology on ODP.

If you are an **API provider**, working with some of our members or other firms in the financial world, we can host your API on ODP: the full FINOS Community can get to know your technology, and contributors will get free and preferred access to the API, delivering a first-class onramp experience for developers.

**Everyone is welcome to read, listen and submit feedback** to the group; all our content and conversations are (and will be) public.
